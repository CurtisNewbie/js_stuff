    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>I want you to create a simple guess the number type game. It should choose a random number between 1 and 100,
        then
        challenge the player to guess the number in 10 turns. After each turn the player should be told if they are
        right or
        wrong and, if they are wrong, whether the guess was too low or too high. It should also tell the player what
        numbers
        they previously guessed. The game will end once the player guesses correctly, or once they run out of turns.
        When the
        game ends, the player should be given an option to start playing again.
    </p>
